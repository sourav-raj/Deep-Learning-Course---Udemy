Content of Deep Learning course & its assignment that I learned during that time.
It contains implementation of ANN, CNN, SOM, RNN, LSTM.

Projects included:

Churn Prediction using ANN,
Credit Card Fraud detection using SOM,
Mnist HandWritten digit classification,
Stock Prediction using LSTM

It also describe implementaion of tensorflow basics & also usage of Keras library
